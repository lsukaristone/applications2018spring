	<h1>Skills Used in Creating this Project</h1>
<p>My project was unique in that I was working with already created designs to implement a concept. It is not unusual to draw inspiration from other sources but because my fonts and styles came from an already established style guide, I wanted to list out the skills I used for this project:</p>
<ul>
	<li id="one">Working off of an established style guide</li>
		<li class="sub">Matching fonts, line weights and color schemes in my work so it fits seamlessly into the project.</li>

	<li>Identifying a specific user need and finding a way to address it within the constraints presented by a client/stakeholder</li>
		<li class="sub">When talking to my boss he noted the infeasibility of creating a whole new website for a ‘Neighborhood Report’ configurator. While creating a survey type configurator may have addressed the prompt for the class more effectively/straightforwardly, I wanted to find a solution that may actually be implementable while still being a configurator. </li>


	<li>Recreating styles in sketch</li>
		<li class="sub">I did not screenshot anything besides the front page map, everything else was recreated or created from scratch in sketch</li>

	<li>Communicating a concept for a user without much prior explanation</li>
		<li class="sub">I purposely decided not to include a long explanation of how the pinning system works on the website. Because we are accustomed to adding things to carts, ‘starring’ or ‘pinning’ things of interest, I wanted to draw on that user tendency in a different context. While a little experimentation I think my concept would be easy to understand for most user types.</li>

	<li>Pitching a project/feature expansion to an organization by laying out my process, reasoning behind design decisions, and creating a clickable mockup to showcase my vision</li>
		<li class="sub">I plan on pitching this project to the company next week because I think it addresses an important need. We’ll see how it goes but I think it’s invaluable practice.</li>
