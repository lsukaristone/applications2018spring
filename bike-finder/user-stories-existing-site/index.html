<h1>Kelly User Story</h1>

<ol>
<li>As Kelly, I want a comfortable bike so I can leisurely ride places both near and far.</li> 

<li>As Kelly, I type 'women's bikes' in the search bar because I figure that will be the most comfortable for me. </li>

<li>As Kelly I select the filter for 2-9 speeds so that the bike is easy to ride and handle. </li>

<li>As Kelly, I select the filters for 'Comfort and Hybrid Bikes' and 'Cruiser' bikes because I think they would both fulfill my need for good-looking easy to ride bikes. </li>

<li>As Kelly, I do not select a price range because I am willing to spend more money to get the bike that fits all of my needs and wants. </li>

<li>As Kelly, I select the filter for customer ratings of 4 of 5 stars and above so that I don't end up purchasing a bike that is poorly rated. </li>

<li>As Kelly, I browse through the 2 pages of search results, looking for a bike that visually appeals to me because the appearance of the bike matters since I will be riding with friends. </li>

<li>As Kelly, I select a bike that looks comfortable as well as visually appealing and read the item details to confirm it fits my wants and needs. </li>
